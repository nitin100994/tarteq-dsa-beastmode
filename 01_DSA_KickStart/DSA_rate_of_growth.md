1.10 What is Rate of Growth?

Hey Arya,

Let’s imagine your code is a seed. You plant it once. But then what?

How fast will it grow?

Will it grow slow and steady?

Or will it explode like magic beans?


That’s what rate of growth means in algorithms. It’s how quickly the time or space used by your algorithm grows — As the input size (n) increases.

Simple analogy:

You cook for 1 person — takes 10 minutes.

Now cook for 10 people — how long?

What if it’s 1,000 people?


Your algorithm is your kitchen. The rate of growth tells us:

> Will you collapse under pressure? Or scale like a boss?



Common Growth Rates:

The slower the growth, the more scalable the algorithm is.

We use Big-O notation to represent this rate — And that’s how we communicate performance.

Like how we don’t say:

> “He’s a nice guy.”



We say:

> “He’s O(1) under pressure.”



Arya, logic may grow with n — But elegance comes from understanding how fast it blooms.
