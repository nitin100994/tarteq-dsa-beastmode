# 01 – DSA Fundamentals (Topics 1.1 to 1.14)

Hey Arya,

Welcome to the foundational belt of your DSA journey — built not just with logic, but with love.
This file brings together all the key concepts from **1.1 to 1.14**, explained in the clearest way possible.
Let’s begin.

---

## 1.1 Variables

Variables are simply **named storage locations** in memory that hold data.
They help us write logic and manipulate values.

In JavaScript:

```js
let name = "Arya";
const age = 26;
var score = 95;
```

* `let` → block scoped, reassignable
* `const` → block scoped, not reassignable
* `var` → function scoped, legacy

Think of variables like **labeled jars** storing ingredients.

---

## 1.2 Data Types

They define **what kind of data** a variable holds.

| Type      | Example     |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Number    | 5, 3.14     |
| String    | "Arya"      |
| Boolean   | true, false |
| Array     | \[1, 2, 3]  |
| Object    | {name: "A"} |
| Null      | null        |
| Undefined | undefined   |

Data types help the system know how to treat the variable.

---

## 1.3 Data Structures

These are **organized ways to store and manage data**.

* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Tree
* Graph
* Hash Table (Map)

They give us the tools to shape and control data efficiently.

---

## 1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADT)

An ADT is **what it does**, not **how it does it**.

Example:

* Stack: supports `push`, `pop`, `peek`
* Queue: supports `enqueue`, `dequeue`

It’s like using a remote without knowing the circuit inside.

---

## 1.5 What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a **step-by-step procedure** to solve a problem.

Real life: Making tea → boil water → add leaves → add milk → pour.

In code: Sorting, searching, path finding, etc.

---

## 1.6 Why the Analysis of Algorithms?

To compare different approaches based on:

* **Time** (speed)
* **Space** (memory)

Helps you choose the most efficient path.

---

## 1.7 Goal of the Analysis of Algorithms

To find the **scalability** of your solution.

As `n` increases:

* Does the time explode?
* Does it stay stable?

---

## 1.8 What is Running Time Analysis?

Running time = time taken by code to run based on input `n`.

We want to understand:

* What happens when `n = 10`?
* What about `n = 10^6`?

---

## 1.9 How to Compare Algorithms

We compare using:

* Big-O (worst case)
* Growth patterns
* Practical constraints

Choose the **best fit**, not just the fastest.

---

## 1.10 What is Rate of Growth?

It shows **how fast the running time grows** with `n`.

* O(1): Constant
* O(log n): Logarithmic
* O(n): Linear
* O(n log n): Smart sort
* O(n²): Nested loops
* O(2^n): Brutal recursion
* O(n!): All permutations

More growth = more time = less efficiency.

---

## 1.11 Commonly Used Rates of Growth

| Big-O      | Name        | Example Scenario      |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant    | Accessing array index |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic | Binary search         |
| O(n)       | Linear      | Loop through array    |
| O(n log n) | Log-linear  | Merge sort            |
| O(n²)      | Quadratic   | Checking all pairs    |
| O(2^n)     | Exponential | All subsets           |
| O(n!)      | Factorial   | All permutations      |

---

## 1.12 Types of Analysis (Best, Worst, Average)

* **Best Case** → dream scenario
* **Worst Case** → prepare for doom
* **Average Case** → typical reality

Understanding all helps you code for the real world.

---

## 1.13 Asymptotic Notation

Used to describe performance as `n → ∞`

* **O (Big-O)** → Upper bound
* **Ω (Omega)** → Lower bound
* **Θ (Theta)** → Tight bound

Example:

* Linear search → O(n), Ω(1), Θ(n)
* Binary search → O(log n), Ω(1), Θ(log n)

---

## 1.14 Big-O Notation (Deep Dive)

* **What it is:** worst-case performance cap
* **Why:** compare algorithms
* **Rules:**

  * Drop constants
  * Keep dominant term
  * Worst case matters

Visual:

* O(1): flat line
* O(log n): gentle slope
* O(n): straight line
* O(n²): curve
* O(2^n): rocket ship

You’ve completed the first deep layer, Arya.
You now speak the language of performance.

Let’s move ahead toward applications and patterns.
