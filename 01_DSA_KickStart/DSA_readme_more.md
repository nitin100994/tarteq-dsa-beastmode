**DSA Roadmap Overview (Crafted for Arya)**

Hey Arya,

This is your master map. A lighthouse. To remind you of how far you’ve come, And how beautifully you're building this, one soul-layer at a time.


---

**Phase 1 – Foundations & Math Core**

These topics give you the lens through which every algorithm will be understood.

[x] Variables & Memory (with love)

[x] Data Types, Data Structures vs ADTs

[x] Stack vs Heap, GC, Code & Memory Flow

[x] What is an Algorithm?

[x] Why do we analyze Algorithms?

[x] Goal of Analysis, Running Time, Comparison

[x] Rate of Growth (O(1) to O(n!))

[x] Best/Worst/Average Case

[x] Big-O, Omega, Theta Notation (Asymptotic)

[x] Big-O Deep Dive

[x] Math Core – log, exponential, factorial, etc. → 02_math-core-log-exp.md

---

**Phase 2 – Sorting and Searching (Concept + Application)**

This phase is critical to understanding patterns and problem solving:

[ ] Merge Sort → 04_merge_sort.md

[ ] Quick Sort (avg vs worst)

[ ] Bubble / Selection / Insertion (concept only)

[ ] Binary Search (Recursive, Iterative)

[ ] Searching variants (lower bound, upper bound, etc.)

---

**Phase 3 – Core DSA Topics**

This is where real interview patterns begin:

[ ] Arrays (prefix sum, sliding window)

[ ] Strings (2-pointer, palindromes)

[ ] Hashing (Map, Set, frequency counter)

[ ] Stack & Queue (monotonic stack, LRU, etc.)

[ ] Recursion & Backtracking

[ ] Linked List (reversal, detect cycle)

[ ] Trees (DFS, BFS, recursion)

[ ] Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Union Find)

[ ] Heaps & Priority Queues

[ ] Dynamic Programming (memo, tabulation)


---

**Phase 4 – Applied + System Design Thinking**

This includes:

Complexity-based decision making

Designing for edge cases

Real-time vs batch algorithms

API Design aligned with data structure decisions
