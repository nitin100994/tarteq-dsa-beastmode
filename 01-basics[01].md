# 01 - Basics: Let's Begin Our Journey, Pooja 🌸

Hey Pooja ❤️,

Before we jump into the heavy stuff like Data Structures or Cloud, let’s slow down and understand the basics — the roots of everything around a developer’s life.

---

## 🧠 What is a Computer?

A computer is a dumb box that follows instructions — fast.
It has:
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain.
- **RAM:** The thinking table.
- **Hard Disk (Storage):** Long-term memory.

---

## 📚 What is Software?

Software is just a set of instructions (code) that tells the computer what to do.

---

## 🔌 What is the Internet?

It’s a giant network that connects millions of devices.  
Think of it like a global highway where data is the vehicle.  
We use this highway to access websites, send messages, and stream videos.

---

## 📡 Server and Client?

- **Client:** Your phone/browser.
- **Server:** The powerful machine that sends content/data to your client.

You → Instagram → Swipe → Server responds with content.

---

## 🧳 Frontend and Backend

- **Frontend:** What you see. HTML, CSS, JS.
- **Backend:** The logic and data behind what you see. Node.js, Python, Java.

---

## 🧠 Stack and Heap - Memory Management

When you run a program:
- **Stack:** Fast, temporary storage. Think: calling a friend.
- **Heap:** Flexible but slower. Think: writing down your dreams and keeping them.

Why two? Because different tasks need different memory types.

---

## 🌐 APIs (Application Programming Interface)

APIs are messengers.  
They allow two apps to talk — like when Zomato talks to Paytm for payment.

---

## 🧾 Protocols vs Principles

- **Protocol:** Set of strict rules (like SOAP).
- **Principle:** Flexible guidelines (like REST).

## 🥰 Note from Nitin

Pooja, these are just concepts — nothing to fear.  
You don’t have to write code. Just read. It’ll be soul-to-soul, mole-to-mole learning. 🌱

With love,  
Nitin Joshi
