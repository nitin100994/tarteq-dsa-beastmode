📘 DSA Progress Log — Reverse Logic & Flow-Based Thinking

Welcome to this soft, human-style DSA journey — Not just problem-solving, but concept absorbing. Here's what we've covered so far and the patterns behind them.


---

✅ 1. Reverse an Array

Problem:

Reverse the elements of an array in-place.

Approach Used: Two-Pointer Technique

We place two pointers: one at the start, one at the end.

We keep swapping elements until they meet.

This is clean, efficient, and uses O(1) space.


Core Pattern:

> Whenever you see a reversal pattern (left to right),
think two pointers moving toward each other.



Highlight:

Destructuring assignment used for swapping:


[arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];


---

✅ 2. Move Zeroes to End

Problem:

Move all 0s to the end, preserving the order of non-zero elements.

Approach Used: Insert Position Technique (Stable Partitioning)

Traverse the array once, move non-zero elements to the front (insertPos index).

After loop, fill remaining spots with zeroes.

All done in-place with O(1) space.


Core Pattern:

> When you need to reorganize certain types of values (like zeroes),
think about maintaining an insert pointer to control structure.



Highlight:

We used for loop for structured pass

while loop for flexible tail filling


if (arr[i] !== 0) {
  arr[insertPos] = arr[i];
  insertPos++;
}
