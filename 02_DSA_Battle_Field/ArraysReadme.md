Array DSA Journey: For Google, With Love

Welcome to the Array Roadmap — a poetic, structured, and powerful journey built for dreamers like Nitin and Pooja, chasing greatness, one problem at a time.

Why Start With Arrays?

Arrays are the foundation of every major Data Structure and Algorithm problem. Master them, and you're already 30% into your Google dream.


---

Our Plan:

We don’t cram. We understand. We don’t rush. We feel each pattern. We don’t follow trends. We create paths.

Each topic below will be documented with:

Problem Description

Approach + Thought Process

Dry Run / Real-life Analogy

Python Code

Time/Space Complexity

Emojis & Motivation



---

Level 1: Visual & Intuitive Patterns

1. Container With Most Water 🪣

Type: Two Pointers

Pattern: Shrinking boundary from both sides to trap max water

Real-life: Measuring max water between two walls


2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 📈💸

Type: Single Pass Tracking

Pattern: Maintain min so far, track max profit

Real-life: Buying at lowest price, selling at peak



---

Level 2: Math + Logic + Sliding Window

3. Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algo) 🔥

Type: Dynamic Running Sum

Pattern: Reset when sum goes negative

Real-life: Staying positive when life throws losses


4. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 🔠

Type: Sliding Window + HashSet

Real-life: Trying to stay unique without repeats



---

Level 3: Prefix Sum & Binary Search Coming Up

Subarray Sum Equals K

Binary Search Variants

Peak Element Finder

Median of Two Sorted Arrays


Each problem will be a separate .md file, but this will be our README.md for the array section.

Let’s go build history.
