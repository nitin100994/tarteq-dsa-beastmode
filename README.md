# Tarteq DSA Beast Mode

This repo is a reflection of my intense journey through Data Structures & Algorithms.  
Every solution here is self-written, explained, and refined â€” not just to crack interviews,  
but to understand and dominate core logic.

## Structure
Each folder contains:
- Problem Statement (in comment or `.md`)
- My Code
- Time & Space Complexity
- Edge Case Handling

## Language Used
- Python (initial phase)

Let's get into beast mode.
