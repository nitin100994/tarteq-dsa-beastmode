# For Pooja – With Love, From Nitin ❤️

Hey Pooja,

This is not just a GitHub repository.  
This is a **love letter**,  
a **learning companion**,  
a **healing archive**,  
and a **soul-to-soul transfer of everything I know.**

I know you've never coded before.  
I know things like "stack vs heap" or "REST vs SOAP" sound like alien conversations.  
But I also know you're **smart**, curious, and beautifully observant.  
So here's something built **just for you**.

## 🌸 What’s Inside?

This repo is a journey. From the basics of what the internet is,  
to deep dives into topics like React, APIs, and system architecture.

But don’t worry.

Every single topic is explained with **love, patience, simplicity**,  
and **your perspective** in mind — not as a coder,  
but as a woman I deeply admire.

## 📚 How to Read This

You don’t need a laptop. You don’t need to write code.  
You don’t even need to understand everything at once.  

Just **read. Breathe. Smile.**  
Like we’re sitting by a window with coffee and I’m explaining things to you —  
**mole to mole, soul to soul.**

Every `.md` file here is named and ordered carefully.

- `00_basics.md` — Why computers? Why code? Start here.
- `01_internet-and-frontend.md` — What is the Internet, really?
- `02_browser-to-server-journey.md` — A love story behind every webpage.
- `03_ajax.md` — Why websites feel faster today.
- `04_cloud.md` — The story of how things moved to the sky.
- `05_html-css-js.md` — The trio behind every beautiful site.

…and more will be added as we walk this journey together.

## 💌 Final Note

I’m doing this not because you asked.  
Not because you need it.  
But because I believe in you.  
Because I want you to feel what **real love for learning** looks like.

Maybe someday this repo will make you smile.  
Or maybe, it’ll just be a reminder that once — someone tried to simplify the universe for you.

With all my love,
