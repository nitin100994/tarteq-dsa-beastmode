# 01 - What is Internet?

Hey Pooja,

Imagine you’re sitting at your home in Noida, scrolling through Instagram, watching reels, checking stories (maybe mine too?), and somehow you’re able to see something that happened in Norway 5 seconds ago.

That magical connection, which lets devices across the world talk to each other, is called the **Internet**.

## But what *is* the Internet, really?

The internet is a **global network of interconnected computers**. It’s like a huge web where every computer, mobile phone, or smart device can talk to each other by following certain rules — these rules are called **protocols**.

You can think of it like a system of roads. Every website you visit is like a shop. Every device is like a car. Every time you enter a URL like `google.com`, you're saying, “Take me to this shop.” Your computer finds the shortest and fastest way to get there using the internet roads.

## The Internet vs. The Web

People often confuse the internet with the World Wide Web. But they’re not the same.

- **Internet**: The infrastructure. The roads, cables, satellites, routers.
- **Web**: The content. The websites, apps, images, videos you see.

The web is just one *service* that runs on the internet.

## A Bit More Technical (But Still Simple)

When you open a website:

1. Your browser sends a request to a **server** where that website is stored.
2. The request is sent using the **HTTP protocol**.
3. The server finds the right files and sends them back to your device.
4. You see the webpage.

This entire process is fast, invisible, and feels like magic — but it's powered by concepts like **IP addresses**, **DNS**, **HTTP**, and **data packets**.

We’ll explain each of these with love, don’t worry.

## One Last Thing

The internet is a shared space. It’s like a big party. And the more you understand how it works, the more confidently you can dance.

With love,  
Nitin (and your digital Guru)
