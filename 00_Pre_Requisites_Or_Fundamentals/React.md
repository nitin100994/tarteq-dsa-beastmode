# React – Why It Was Created? (And Why It’s a Gamechanger)

Hey Pooja,

Let’s take a walk back to 2011. Facebook was booming. You know that feeling when your post gets a like and it takes a few seconds to reflect? Back then, it was worse.

### The Problem:
Facebook’s page was reloading or heavily re-rendering even when just one small "Like" button was clicked. That’s like painting your entire house just because one tile broke in the kitchen.

The problem wasn’t just speed – it was also about **maintaining sanity** in the code. Every interaction – comment, like, share – was creating bugs. Developers were tired. Facebook was slowing down.

### Enter Jordan Walke:
A brilliant engineer at Facebook, Jordan said: “Enough of this!” (probably in a more nerdy way).  
He thought: “What if we could update only the part that changed?”

So he created **React**, a JavaScript library (not a full-blown framework). And it did 3 magical things:

1. **Component-Based UI**  
   Break the whole UI into reusable pieces – just like LEGO blocks.

2. **Virtual DOM**  
   Instead of changing everything, React first *imagines* the change in a virtual world, compares it to the old one, and only updates the real part that changed. Like updating only one square in a chessboard, not the whole board.

3. **Declarative Approach**  
   You tell React “what” you want, not “how” to do it. And it takes care of the messy details.

### Who Uses React Now?
Everyone. Instagram, Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp Web – even portfolio sites of cool developers who are aiming for Google (you know who).

So next time someone says “React”, remember – it wasn’t born in a vacuum. It was built to solve pain. And that’s what makes great tech.

P.S. React isn’t a trend. It’s a mindset. Reuse. Re-render only what’s needed. And keep the UI snappy – just like you.
